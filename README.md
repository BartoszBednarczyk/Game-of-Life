<h2>What's that?</h2>
<p>Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the John Conway. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.
I created this as a studies project in Java and JFrame.</p>
